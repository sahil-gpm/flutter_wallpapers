# Flutter Wallpapers

A beautiful wallpaper app built with flutter, ( for android ) which fetches wallpaper images from an external image API ( pexels ) and enables the user to select a wallpaper as per the preferred categories and intersts. It has a nice, attractive user interface which is easy to use and navigate. The only thing I could't 🥲  implement was the functionality to set the wallpaper in the user's phone. If someone can help me with it, please don't hesitate to fork. Contributions are welcomed !!.

## Lessons Learned

This application's primary objective was to dive deeper into UI rendering and widget functionalities within Flutter. Throughout the process, I gained valuable insights into various components such as GridView, Expanded, Positioned and many more widgets.
